# HawkTracer

HawkTracer is a highly portable, low-overhead, configurable profiling tool built in Amazon Video for getting performance metrics from low-end devices.

HawkTracer is available on most popular platforms: **Linux**, **Windows**, **OS X**. The library can be used with **C** and **C++**.

The library provides many different types of events (e.g. CPU usage event, duration tracepoint), but the list can easily be extended by the user.

## Features
* Low CPU/memory overhead
* Multi-platform
* Highly configurable on runtime
* Easy build integration (CMake & pkg-config files)
* Pre-defined and user-defined events
* Simple macros for code instrumentation
* Streaming events to file, through TCP/IP protocol, or handling them in custom function
* Client for receiving event stream
* Library for parsing event stream (so you can write your own client)

## License Summary

This sample code is made available under the MIT license. 
(See [LICENSE](LICENSE) file)

## Getting Started

### Building library
```bash
$ mkdir build       # It'll be different on Windows
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build .   # This instead of make, so we don't need extra instructions for Windows
```

## Attaching HawkTracer to a project to profile

### Build system integration

#### CMake-based projects
If you use CMake build system, you can use following code to attach HawkTracer library to your project:
```cmake
project(your_project)

# optionally, you might define a path to HawkTracer's CMake module
# CMake the path below should be a path to a directory where HawkTracerConfig.cmake is located, e.g.:
# list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "/usr/local/lib/cmake/HawkTracer")

find_package(HawkTracer REQUIRED)

add_executable(your_project main.cc)

target_link_libraries(your_project HawkTracer::hawktracer)

```

#### pkg-config
HawkTracer library provides pkg-config file which can be used to find required libraries and include paths. You can simply integrate it e.g. with your compilation command:
```bash
$ g++ my_project.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags --libs hawktracer)
```

### Instrumenting code

#### Initialize library

Before you start profiling your code, you need to initialize HawkTracer library. There are 2 functions which always have to be called in projects profiled by HawkTracer: `ht_init` and `ht_deinit`.
Additionally, you need to specify an event listener. HawkTracer currently provides 2 listeners:
* TCP listener, which streams events over the network
* File dump listener, which saves events to a file.

Moreover, HawkTracer allows to provide user-defined listeners.
Code below presents example HawkTracer (un)initialization:
```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
  ht_init(argc, argv); // initialize library
  HT_Timeline* timeline = ht_global_timeline_get(); // timeline, where all events are posted. You can define your own timeline, or use global timeline
  HT_FileDumpListener listener;
  const size_t buffer_size = 4096; // size of internal listener's buffer
  ht_file_dump_listener_init(&listener, "file_name.htdump", buffer_size); // initialize listener
  ht_timeline_register_listener(timeline, ht_file_dump_listener_callback, &listener); // register listener to a timeline

  // your code goes here...
  
  ht_timeline_flush(timeline); // flush all remaining events from timeline
  ht_timeline_unregister_all_listeners(timeline); // unregister listeners from timeline
  ht_file_dump_listener_deinit(&listener); // deinitialize listener
  ht_deinit(); // uninitialize library

  return 0;
}

```
The code registers file dump listener, which saves all the events to a file `file_name.htdump`. The file should be then converted to a viewer's format ([see here for details](#collect-the-data)).

#### Instrumenting the code
HawkTracer requires explicit code instrumentation. The library provides a few helper macros for reporting data to a timeline:
```cpp
// Pushes any type of event to a timeline
HT_TIMELINE_PUSH_EVENT(TIMELINE, EVENT_TYPE, EVENT_PARAMETERS,...)

// Reports a duration of specific block of code (available only for C++ or C GNU compiler)
HT_TP_STRACEPOINT(TIMELINE, LABEL)

// The same as above, but automatically sets label to current function name
HT_TP_FUNCTION(TIMELINE)
```
There are few macros which report events to a global timeline, they're prefixed with `G_`:
```cpp
HT_TP_G_STRACEPOINT(LABEL)
HT_TP_G_FUNCTION()
```
For example, you can instrument following code:
```cpp
void foo()
{
  HT_TP_G_FUNCTION() // measure duration of foo function execution
  
  for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
  {
    HT_TP_G_STRACEPOINT("in-loop") // measure duration of single loop iteration
	bar();
  }
}
```

### Collect the data

For now HawkTracer provides a simple application for converting event stream to a JSON format which can be consumed by the viewing application: `hawktracer-to-json`. You can use it with a file or with a network stream. Assuming your events have been saved to `file_name.htdump` file, you can generate the JSON file running following command:
```bash
hawktracer-to-json --source file_name.htdump --output output_file.json
```

### Analyzing the data

* Install google-chrome or chromium browser
* Open the browser, and open [chrome://tracing/](chrome://tracing) webpage
* Click load button and open file generated in the previous section
* You should see a callstack with timing
